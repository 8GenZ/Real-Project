        <h2>What i know about Marvel</h2>
        <p>
            Marvel Comics is an American comic book publisher and the property of The Walt Disney Company since December
            31, 2009.

            Marvel was started in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics,[3] and by 1951 had generally become known as
            Atlas Comics. The Marvel era began in June 1961 with the launch of The Fantastic Four and other superhero
            titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko and many others. The Marvel brand, which had been used
            over the years and decades, was solidified as the company's primary brand.

            Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America,
            Thor, Doctor Strange, Hulk, Daredevil, Wolverine, Black Panther, and Captain Marvel, as well as popular
            superhero teams such as the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of
            well-known supervillains includes the likes of Doctor Doom, Magneto, Ultron, Thanos, Kang the Conqueror,
            Green Goblin, Red Skull, Galactus, Loki, and Kingpin. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate in a
            single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
            characters are based in New York City, New York, United States.[4] Additionally, Marvel has published
            several licensed properties from other companies. This includes Star Wars comics twice from 1977 to 1986 and
            again since 2015.

            Pulp-magazine publisher Martin Goodman created the company later known as Marvel Comics under the name
            Timely Publications in 1939.[5][6] Goodman, who had started with a Western pulp in 1933, was expanding into
            the emerging—and by then already highly popular—new medium of comic books. Launching his new line from his
            existing company's offices at 330 West 42nd Street, New York City, he officially held the titles of editor,
            managing editor, and business manager, with Abraham Goodman (Martin's brother)[7] officially listed as
            publisher.[6]

            Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 (cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl
            Burgos' android superhero the Human Torch, and the first appearances of Bill Everett's anti-hero Namor the
            Sub-Mariner,[8] among other features.[5] The issue was a great success; it and a second printing the
            following month sold a combined nearly 900,000 copies.[9] While its contents came from an outside packager,
            Funnies, Inc.,[5] Timely had its own staff in place by the following year. The company's first true editor,
            writer-artist Joe Simon, teamed with artist Jack Kirby to create one of the first patriotically themed
            superheroes,[10] Captain America, in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941). It, too, proved a hit, with
            sales of nearly one million.[9] Goodman formed Timely Comics, Inc., beginning with comics cover-dated April
            1941 or Spring 1941.[3][11]

            While no other Timely character would achieve the success of these three characters, some notable
            heroes—many of which continue to appear in modern-day retcon appearances and flashbacks—include the Whizzer,
            Miss America, the Destroyer, the original Vision, and the Angel. Timely also published one of humor
            cartoonist Basil Wolverton's best-known features, "Powerhouse Pepper",[12][13] as well as a line of
            children's talking animal comics featuring characters like Super Rabbit and the duo Ziggy Pig and Silly
            Seal.

            Goodman hired his wife's 16-year-old cousin,[14] Stanley Lieber, as a general office assistant in 1939.[15]
            When editor Simon left the company in late 1941,[16] Goodman made Lieber—by then writing pseudonymously as
            "Stan Lee"—interim editor of the comics line, a position Lee kept for decades except for three years during
            his military service in World War II. Lee wrote extensively for Timely, contributing to a number of
            different titles.

            Goodman's business strategy involved having his various magazines and comic books published by a number of
            corporations all operating out of the same office and with the same staff.[3] One of these shell companies
            through which Timely Comics was published was named Marvel Comics by at least Marvel Mystery Comics #55 (May
            1944). As well, some comics' covers, such as All Surprise Comics #12 (Winter 1946–47), were labeled "A
            Marvel Magazine" many years before Goodman would formally adopt the name in 1961.[17]
