        <p>
            Doctor Strange is a powerful and enigmatic superhero in the Marvel Universe. Originally a brilliant and
            arrogant neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange, his life drastically changed after a car accident left him with
            severe damage to his hands, shattering his surgical career. In search of a cure, he embarks on a journey to
            the mystical realm and encounters the Ancient One, who teaches him the ancient arts of sorcery and
            transforms him into the Sorcerer Supreme. Driven by a desire to protect Earth from mystical threats, Doctor
            Strange wields an array of magical abilities, including spellcasting, astral projection, and the
            manipulation of time and dimensions. He defends reality from mystical villains and interdimensional threats,
            often confronting dark forces with his strategic intellect and unwavering determination. Doctor Strange
            serves as a guardian of the multiverse, blending his scientific background with arcane knowledge to maintain
            the delicate balance between worlds and dimensions</p>
        <h2 class="pt2">Feats</h2>
        <p>
            One of Doctor Strange's most impressive feats occurred during the events of "Avengers: Infinity War." In a
            desperate attempt to protect the universe from the mad titan Thanos, Strange engages in a titanic battle
            against him on the devastated planet of Titan. Demonstrating his mastery of the mystic arts, Doctor Strange
            creates countless mystical projections of himself to confuse and overwhelm Thanos. He employs his ability to
            manipulate time, creating a time loop that traps Thanos, forcing him to relive the same moment repeatedly.
            This incredible display of power showcases Doctor Strange's strategic brilliance and his ability to
            manipulate the very fabric of reality. Despite ultimately succumbing to defeat, his actions serve a greater
            purpose as part of his larger plan to ensure the Avengers' victory in the future. This feat exemplifies
            Doctor Strange's extraordinary power and unwavering dedication to protecting the universe from imminent
            destruction.</p>
