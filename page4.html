                        Doctor Strange is a powerful and enigmatic superhero in the Marvel Universe. Originally a
                        brilliant and
                        arrogant neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange, his life drastically changed after a car accident
                        left him with
                        severe damage to his hands, shattering his surgical career. In search of a cure, he embarks on a
                        journey to
                        the mystical realm and encounters the Ancient One, who teaches him the ancient arts of sorcery
                        and
                        transforms him into the Sorcerer Supreme. Driven by a desire to protect Earth from mystical
                        threats, Doctor
                        Strange wields an array of magical abilities, including spellcasting, astral projection, and the
                        manipulation of time and dimensions. He defends reality from mystical villains and
                        interdimensional threats,
                        often confronting dark forces with his strategic intellect and unwavering determination. Doctor
                        Strange
                        serves as a guardian of the multiverse, blending his scientific background with arcane knowledge
                        to maintain
                        the delicate balance between worlds and dimensions
